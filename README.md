AVG PC TuneUp Key Features:

Remember how fast you ran when you got the PC? We can not only help you get back to the original state but also enjoy the Turbo mode to release more power when you need to browse, play, and video.

It’s a bit like permanent doctors and cleaners. We will help you find and solve the gaps and errors that cause your PC problems and clean them up in the process.

We have all been there. You have just reached the end of the most crucial document, and the battery is dead. Now, you can stop wasting battery on unnecessary things, which can last longer.

All of our PCs are messy. Half of the time, we don’t know what it is, whether it is essential and how to delete it. AVG TuneUp Full Version analyzes whether there is all the junk in your PC and show you how to get rid of it with a few clicks. Result? A faster PC and more space for you to use.

Fast progress is excellent, but if you only do it once, it’s not. We continue to work in the background and continuously update the debugging methods to help your PC always run at the highest speed.

Pressing the delete button does not always give you complete peace of mind. Click the “Shredder” button.

It is always a good thing when there is one thing missing to remember. We will continuously monitor your PC and let you know its status. Moreover, even if you are not at your computer, we will carry out routine maintenance to avoid trouble.
